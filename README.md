# Task API Creation
#### (will be deleted soon)

#### - Develop a task functionality enabling users to create a task reminder for a specific contact that will remind them of the task. #Example: Call John at 2:30 pm on Monday

#### Establish an environment that will allow for these task details:

- Task Title
- Task Description
- Task Priority
- Task Due Date & Time

#### Implement an API to manage the task and store the relevant data in the database. Develop CRUD REST APIs for managing the task and the reminders for the specific task. Push all code to Github and provide a link in Upwork

#### Technology Stack: Go, Chi, PostgreSQL.
